**Description**:  
- Developed a predictive model for natural gas prices using trend and seasonal analysis.  
- Decomposed price data into trend and seasonal components using linear regression and sinusoidal modeling.  
- Created an interpolation function to predict future prices based on historical data.  
- Visualized results using Matplotlib to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model.  
**Key Achievements**:  
- Achieved a trend slope of 0.0013 and seasonal amplitude of 0.6658.  
- Successfully combined trend and seasonality to create a final predictive model.
